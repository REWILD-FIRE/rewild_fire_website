I am a researcher interested in different aspects of forest ecology and management, especially
those related to wildfires. I have participated in several research projects in Italy and abroad,
and collaborate actively with several research groups worldwide. Currently, I am leading a
research line focused on lightning-ignited wildfires. For more information, please visit my
