<h3>Context</h3>

Reaching net zero Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 is key to limit global warming to 1.5Â°C, and requires in all scenarios active carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (CDR). Nature-based solutions (NBS) offer low-cost options for CDR, which need to be better identified, assessed for their carbon (C) sink potential, and upscaled. NBS include increased protection, restoration, and improved management of forest ecosystems. Rewilding strategies, such as natural reforestation on marginal lands or renaturalization of forests where human action has been interrupted (i.e. "proforestation"), also offer opportunities to increase C sinks. On the other hand, rewilding may also generate unintended consequences, such as increased fire hazard and loss of C through wildfire emissions.

<h3>The project</h3>
        
The REWILD-FIRE will assess the additional C sink associated with promoting reforestation on former agricultural land and proforestation of existing forests. The project will assess tradeoffs between increased biomass C and potential C losses from wildfire emissions and compare choices regarding the spatial planning of reforestation and proforestation throughout the Italian Alps. The project will strive to achieve three specific objectives.
