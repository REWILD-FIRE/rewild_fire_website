## Context

Reaching net zero Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 is key to limit global warming to 1.5°C, and requires in all scenarios
active carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (CDR). Nature-based solutions (NBS) offer low-cost options for CDR, which need to be better
identified, assessed for their carbon (C) sink potential, and upscaled. NBS include increased protection, restoration, and improved
management of forest ecosystems. Rewilding strategies, such as natural reforestation on marginal lands or renaturalization of
forests where human action has been interrupted (i.e. "proforestation"), also offer opportunities to increase C sinks. On the other
hand, rewilding may also generate unintended consequences, such as increased fire hazard and loss of C through wildfire emissions.
