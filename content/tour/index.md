        <h3>Context</h3>

        <div style='text-align: justify;'> Reaching net zero Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 is key to limit global warming to 1.5Â°C, and requires in all scenarios
        active carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (CDR). Nature-based solutions (NBS) offer low-cost options for CDR, which need to be better
        identified, assessed for their carbon (C) sink potential, and upscaled. NBS include increased protection, restoration, and improved
        management of forest ecosystems. Rewilding strategies, such as natural reforestation on marginal lands or renaturalization of
        forests where human action has been interrupted (i.e. "proforestation"), also offer opportunities to increase C sinks. On the other
        hand, rewilding may also generate unintended consequences, such as increased fire hazard and loss of C through wildfire emissions.</div>
